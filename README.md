Change the UI as it looks too much like AI.
change the nav div to be more like on this website https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/ when you scroll down there are clouds that part away
the intro marquee should have information like hobbies like art, music, stories, and it should loop seemlessly

Personal that is hidden from when they visit the site, the only way to get there is if they type the URL in themselves ( class= ) hidden/inactive
my linkedin is https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-cheong-tasticp/ so read and update the skills, and experience
my github is https://github.com/tasticp so update and add some and not all the projects from this to this website
