<!--
The UI looks too much like AI change that,
change the nav div to be more like on this website https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/ as well as copy the light mode and dark mode animation on the site
have a intro marquee
as well as copy the parting clouds animation when you scroll down
remove the Get in Touch button as i already have a email button beside the linkedin button
simplyfiy the resume button to CV button and place it with the github,linkedin,email buttons
add URl #Projects , Portfolio , #Personal that is hidden from when they visit the site, the only way to get there is if they type the URL in themselves ( class= ) hidden/inactive
Remove the side and bottom scroll bars its badly done
