The UI looks too much like AI change that,
change the nav div to be more like on this website https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2025/ as well as copy the light mode and dark mode animation on the site
have a intro marquee
as well as copy the parting clouds animation when you scroll down
remove the Get in Touch button as i already have a email button beside the linkedin button
simplyfiy the resume button to CV button and place it with the github,linkedin,email buttons
add URl #Projects , Portfolio , #Personal that is hidden from when they visit the site, the only way to get there is if they type the URL in themselves
Remove the side and bottom scroll bars its badly done
